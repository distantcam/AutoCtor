AutoCtor is a Roslyn Source Generator that will automatically create a constructor for your class for use with constructor Dependency Injection.

## Usage

### Your code

snippet: Basic

### What gets generated

snippet: BasicGeneratedCode

## More Features

### Post constructor Initialisation

You can mark a method to be called at the end of the constructor with the attribute `[AutoPostConstruct]`. This method must return void.

snippet: PostConstruct

snippet: PostConstructGeneratedCode

Post constructor methods can also take parameters. These parameters will be passed in from the constructor.

snippet: PostConstructWithParametersGeneratedCode

### Argument Guards

Null guards for the arguments to the constructor can be added in 2 ways.

In your project you can add a `AutoCtorGuards` property.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <AutoCtorGuards>true</AutoCtorGuards>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```

In each `AutoConstruct` attribute you can add a setting to enable/disable guards.

snippet: GuardsGeneratedCode

### Property Initialisation

AutoCtor can set properties that are considered as read only properties.

snippet: PropertyExamples

## More examples

You can also initialize readonly fields, and AutoCtor will not include them in the constructor.

snippet: PresetField

snippet: PresetFieldGeneratedCode

If there is a single base constructor with parameters, AutoCtor will include that base constructor in the constructor it creates.

snippet: Inherit

snippet: InheritGeneratedCode

## Embedding the attributes in your project

By default, the `[AutoConstruct]` attributes referenced in your project are contained in an external dll. It is also possible to embed the attributes directly in your project. To do this, you must do two things:

1. Define the MSBuild constant `AUTOCTOR_EMBED_ATTRIBUTES`. This ensures the attributes are embedded in your project.
2. Add `compile` to the list of excluded assets in your `<PackageReference>` element. This ensures the attributes in your project are referenced, insted of the _AutoCtor.Attributes.dll_ library.

Your project file should look like this:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <!--  Define the MSBuild constant    -->
    <DefineConstants>AUTOCTOR_EMBED_ATTRIBUTES</DefineConstants>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <!-- Add the package -->
  <PackageReference Include="AutoCtor"
                    PrivateAssets="all"
                    ExcludeAssets="compile;runtime" />
<!--                               ☝ Add compile to the list of excluded assets. -->

</Project>
```

## Preserving usage of the `[AutoConstruct]` attribute

The `[AutoConstruct]` attributes are decorated with the `[Conditional]` attribute, so their usage will not appear in the build output of your project. If you use reflection at runtime you will not find the `[AutoConstruct]` attributes.

If you wish to preserve these attributes in the build output, you can define the `AUTOCTOR_USAGES` MSBuild variable.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <!--  Define the MSBuild constant    -->
    <DefineConstants>AUTOCTOR_USAGES</DefineConstants>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <!-- Add the package -->
  <PackageReference Include="AutoCtor" PrivateAssets="all" />

</Project>
```
